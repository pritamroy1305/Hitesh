ðŸ“Œ Node.js Notes

1. Why Node.js?

Browsers can only understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

JavaScript inside the browser has limitations (e.g., canâ€™t directly access files, OS-level operations).

Node.js allows running JavaScript outside the browser.

2. What is Node.js?

Built on V8 JavaScript Engine (from Chrome) + C++ bindings.

It is a JavaScript runtime environment, not a language or framework.

3. Key Features
