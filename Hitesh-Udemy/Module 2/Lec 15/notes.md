## 1. Why Node.js?
- Browsers can only understand **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

  (e.g., no direct file system or OS-level access).

- Created by **Ryan Dahl** in 2009.
- Built on:
  - **V8 JavaScript Engine (from Chrome)**  
  - **C++ bindings**
- It is a **JavaScript runtime environment**,  
  not a programming language or framework.

## 3. Key Features
- Runs JavaScript on the **server side**.
- **Non-blocking, event-driven** architecture.

## 4. Use Cases
- âœ… Run JavaScript outside the browser.
- âœ… Build **Web Services / APIs** with JavaScript.
- âœ… Create **CLI (Command Line Interface) tools**.
- âœ… Develop **IoT applications**.
